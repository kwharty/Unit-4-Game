# Unit-4-Game

I tried to make my crystal game a little more fun, by theming it with Villanova Basketball players. The goal is for them to tie the opponent, so nove can head into overtime and win glory that way.

I had it working, save for a viable "reset" option. The score kept continuing to go up.

in fixing that, I broke everything. I've tried several wedbsights (i.e. JSHint) to uncover the problem, but some syntax is off somewhere.
